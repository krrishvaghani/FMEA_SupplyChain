---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Navigate to [https://github.com/charmi2208/Symboisis](https://github.com/charmi2208/Symboisis)  
Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.  
This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Symboisis.git
cd Symboisis
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### Step 3: Add Upstream Remote

Add the original repository as an upstream remote to keep your fork synced:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/charmi2208/Symboisis.git
```

Verify the remotes:
```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see:

- `origin` - your fork ([https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Symboisis.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Symboisis.git))
- `upstream` - the original repository ([https://github.com/charmi2208/Symboisis.git](https://github.com/charmi2208/Symboisis.git))

### Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 5: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 6: Download Required NLTK Data
```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')"
```

### Step 7: Set Up Environment File

Copy the example environment file and fill in your settings:

**Windows:**
```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Most fields in `.env` are optional. The system works without any API keys using rule-based mode.

### Step 8: Run the App to Verify Setup
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser. If the dashboard loads, your setup is complete.

Alternatively, test with the CLI:
```bash
python cli.py --structured FMEA.csv --output output/test.xlsx --no-model
```

### Step 9: Create a New Branch

> **IMPORTANT:** Always create a new branch for your work. Never work directly on the `main` branch.
```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**

- `feature/` — for new features (e.g., `feature/voice-input`)
- `fix/` — for bug fixes (e.g., `fix/rpn-calculation-error`)
- `docs/` — for documentation (e.g., `docs/update-setup-guide`)
- `style/` — for styling changes (e.g., `style/dashboard-theme`)
- `refactor/` — for code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/preprocessing-module`)
- `test/` — for adding tests (e.g., `test/risk-scoring-unit-tests`)

## 💻 Development Workflow

### 1. Pick an Issue

Browse the Issues page at [https://github.com/charmi2208/Symboisis/issues](https://github.com/charmi2208/Symboisis/issues)

Look for issues labelled:
- `good first issue` or `level: beginner` — for beginners
- `level: intermediate` — for intermediate contributors
- `level: advanced` — for advanced contributors

Comment on the issue with your request and team number, e.g.:
> "Hi, I'd like to work on this issue. - Team 07"

Wait to be officially assigned — do not start writing any code until a maintainer assigns you.  
Do not work on an issue already assigned to someone else.

### 2. Understand the Project Structure

Before writing any code, read these files in order:

- `START_HERE.md` — overall orientation for new contributors
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` — fast lookup for common commands and file purposes
- `USAGE_GUIDE.md` — how the system is used end to end
- `YOUR_DATA_GUIDE.md` — how to work with FMEA.csv and car review datasets
- `SETUP.md` — detailed setup troubleshooting

Understand which module your issue touches:

- `src/preprocessing.py` — text cleaning, sentiment analysis
- `src/llm_extractor.py` — LLM-based field extraction
- `src/risk_scoring.py` — Severity, Occurrence, Detection, RPN calculation
- `src/fmea_generator.py` — main orchestration class
- `src/utils.py` — shared helper functions
- `app.py` — Streamlit dashboard
- `cli.py` — command line interface
- `mitigation_module/` — mitigation plan generation
- `config/config.yaml` — all configurable parameters

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable Python code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Add docstrings to any new function you create
- Do not change unrelated files — keep your PR focused on one issue only
- Test your changes by running the app and CLI before submitting

### 4. Test Your Changes

Run the dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Run the CLI with sample data:
```bash
python cli.py --structured FMEA.csv --output output/test.xlsx --no-model
```

Run the examples:
```bash
python examples.py
```

Run pytest if your issue involves `src/` modules:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

If your issue adds new logic, add at least one test in the `tests/` folder.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add voice input processor to app.py"
```

**Commit Message Format:**

- `feat:` — new feature (e.g., `feat: add dark mode toggle`)
- `fix:` — bug fix (e.g., `fix: resolve RPN calculation error`)
- `docs:` — documentation changes (e.g., `docs: update setup guide`)
- `style:` — formatting or CSS changes (e.g., `style: improve dashboard theme`)
- `refactor:` — code restructuring (e.g., `refactor: simplify preprocessing logic`)
- `test:` — adding or updating tests (e.g., `test: add unit tests for risk scoring`)
- `chore:` — maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore: update requirements.txt`)

### 6. Push to Your Fork
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request

Go to your fork on GitHub: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Symboisis`  
Click **"Compare & pull request"** button.  
Fill out the PR template completely:

- **Title:** Clear, descriptive title (e.g., `Add OCR document upload to dashboard`)
- **Team Number:** You must state your team number (e.g., Team 07) — PRs without this will be closed
- **Issue Reference:** Link the assigned issue (e.g., `Closes #12`) — PRs without a linked issue will be closed
- **Description:** Explain what changes you made and why
- **Screenshots:** Add before/after screenshots if dashboard UI changes are involved

Click **"Create pull request"**

### How to Request an Issue

Find an unassigned issue you want to work on.  
Comment on the issue with this format:

> "I'd like to work on this. - Team [your team number]"

Wait for a maintainer to assign it to you — this is mandatory.  
Once assigned, start working and submit your PR within 3–5 days.  
If you can't complete it in time, comment to let maintainers know.

⚠️ Before opening a new issue, ensure:

- The issue does not already exist
- It is clearly documented
- It aligns with the project scope (FMEA generation, supply chain risk, NLP, dashboard, CLI)

---

### Creating a New Issue

When creating a new issue:

- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Add a detailed description:
  - What is the problem or feature?
  - Which file or module does it affect?
  - Steps to reproduce (if a bug)
  - Expected vs actual behaviour
  - Screenshots (if UI-related)
- Wait for maintainer review before starting work

---

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

### PR Requirements — Non-Negotiable

PRs that don't meet **ALL** of the following will be closed without review:

- [ ] Team number stated in the PR description (e.g., Team XX)
- [ ] Linked to your assigned issue via `Closes #issue-number`
- [ ] You are the assigned contributor for that issue
- [ ] PR is raised after assignment, not before

### Before Submitting

- [ ] `streamlit run app.py` runs without errors
- [ ] `python cli.py --structured FMEA.csv --output output/test.xlsx --no-model` works
- [ ] `python -m pytest tests/` passes (or you have documented why a test was skipped)
- [ ] No new `print()` statements added to `src/` modules — use logging instead
- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or `.env` files committed
- [ ] Commit messages follow the conventional format above
- [ ] If dashboard UI was changed, before/after screenshots are in the PR

### PR Review Process

A maintainer will review your PR within 24–48 hours.  
You may be asked to make changes — respond promptly.  
Make requested changes and push to the same branch (PR auto-updates).  
Only maintainers can approve and merge — do not request peers to merge.

### Addressing Review Comments

Make the requested changes, then:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address review comments on voice input validation"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## 🎯 Tips for Success

**Start Small:** Begin with a beginner issue to understand how the pipeline works before touching `src/` modules.

**Run Everything First:** Before changing anything, run `streamlit run app.py` and `python examples.py` to see what the project actually does. You will understand the code far better after seeing it in action.

**Read the Guides:** This repo has detailed documentation for every major feature. `START_HERE.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, and `YOUR_DATA_GUIDE.md` will save you hours.

**Use --no-model:** If you don't have a powerful machine, add `--no-model` to all CLI commands. The rule-based mode is fast and works for most issues without needing a GPU or large model download.

**Ask Questions:** It is better to ask than to waste time going in the wrong direction. Comment on your assigned issue and maintainers will help.

**Be Patient:** Code review takes time — be responsive to feedback when it comes.

**Have Fun:** This is about learning NLP, LLMs, supply chain analysis, and open source collaboration all at once. Enjoy it!
